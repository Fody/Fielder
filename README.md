Converts public fields to public properties

[Introduction to Fody](http://github.com/Fody/Fody/wiki/SampleUsage)

This feature means you can exclude the `{ get; set; }` on your properties and use fields instead.


## Usage

See also [Fody usage](https://github.com/Fody/Fody#usage).


### NuGet installation

Install the [Fielder.Fody NuGet package](https://nuget.org/packages/Fielder.Fody/) and update the [Fody NuGet package](https://nuget.org/packages/Fody/):

```powershell
PM> Install-Package Fody
PM> Install-Package Fielder.Fody
```

The `Install-Package Fody` is required since NuGet always defaults to the oldest, and most buggy, version of any dependency.


### Add to FodyWeavers.xml

Add `<Fielder/>` to [FodyWeavers.xml](https://github.com/Fody/Fody#add-fodyweaversxml)

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<Weavers>
  <Fielder/>
</Weavers>
```


## How does this work

 * For all types find all public instance fields with a capitalised first character
 * Convert all those fields to properties with the same name
 * Find all usages of those fields and point them to the new properties
